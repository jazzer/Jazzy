<h3>What is Jazzy?</h3>
<p align="center">
<img width="600px" src="images/screen.png" alt="Screenshot of current status Jazzy"/>
</p>

<p>The Jazzy <b>server</b> component is handling chess games. It is made with <a href="http://python.org/">Python technology</a> and is special because it supports a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_variant">chess variants</a> out of the box. Moreover it is designed to be really, really flexible to allow anyone with a little knowledge about programming (and chess) to build their own variants. You'd probably wonder how many things you can tweak and change in a game which seems already perfect the way it is. Nevertheless many of the variants are great fun!</p>

<p>With Jazzy you also have access to a web UI based on modern technologies. HTML5, CSS3, Canvas, and Websockets are only a few buzzwords you can see in real life here. You are not bound to any particular operating system, platform (try your smartphone!) or browser, just don't use Mosaic... The board for example supports drag-and-drop as well as click style input with your mouse. All the moves are transfered instantly to the other players and flexible clocks are in place.</p>
